# how to train a convolutional neural network for image classification using transfer learning.

 Instead of random initialization, we initialize the network with a pretrained network, like the one that is trained on imagenet 1000 dataset. Rest of the training looks as usual.

 last fully connected layer is replaced with a new one with random weights and only this layer is trained.

We will use torchvision and torch.utils.data packages for loading the data.

The problem weâ€™re going to solve today is to train a model to classify ants and bees. We have about 120 training images each for ants and bees. There are 75 validation images for each class. Usually, this is a very small dataset to generalize upon, if trained from scratch. Since we are using transfer learning, we should be able to generalize reasonably well.

This dataset is a very small subset of imagenet.
